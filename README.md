# RemoteKu
I created this app to mitigate my frustartions with my Roku TVs I have hung on my wall as monitors for my computers!
As many may know, Roku devices sharte a common standard remote for all devices. So when someone like me has 2 of them
hung on the wall as computer monitors and I need to adjust a setting/volume/anything and 1 remote controls them all,
you can imagine my frustration!! I then created this small GUI tKinter based app to allow you to single out a TV and send
commands to it specifically using the network based API. 

It is a work in progress, but functional none the less.
Utilizes the Requests python library for API calls and tKinter and tk for GUI (see requirements.txt)

-devices.json houses your specific devices IP address information
-main5.py launches app
-all logging is outputed to local directory
